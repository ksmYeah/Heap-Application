Introduction

The Patient Management System is a simple console-based Java application designed to manage a queue of patients based on their severity. It leverages a priority queue (heap) to ensure that patients with the highest severity are always prioritized.

What it Can Do

1. Add Patients: Register patients by providing their name and severity level.


2. View Next Patient: See the next patient to be treated, based on their severity.


3. Process Patients: Remove and display the next patient to be treated.


4. Exit the System: Safely close the application.



Why This Application?

This application was created to demonstrate the practical use of a heap data structure in solving real-world problems. Managing priority queues, like patient severity, is a critical task in healthcare systems. This application contributes to understanding how data structures can optimize processes and decision-making.

How It Helps the Community

The Patient Management System can be a foundational tool for teaching data structures in computer science. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of prioritization in life-critical systems like healthcare.
